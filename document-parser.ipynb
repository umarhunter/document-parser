    "#### What does Langchain do?\n",
    "```document-parser``` is a tool that splits a structured document into smaller chunks. This is done using ```regex``` and ```langchain```, an open-source framework that stores those embeddings (which are now vector representations of the text) into a vector database. This tool is useful for searching and retrieving information from a large document, and may have significant use-cases in GPT/LLM evaluations. The way langchain works is that a user creates a query, this query gets sent to the LLM and a vector representation of that query is used to do a similarity search inside the vector database. This'll fetch the relevant chunks of information from the vector database and feed that into the LLM. Now the LLM has the initial query and the relevant chunks of information to generate a response. This response is then sent back to the user.  "
